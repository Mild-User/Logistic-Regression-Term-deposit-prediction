# Logistic-Regression-Term-deposit-prediction
Data Science includes an umbrella of techniques which are used to extract useful insights from data. Data science is an upcoming field and all what I have to say is it is one of the most exciting careers of all times.

I have approached this term deposit prediction problem in the following steps:

Aim: To predict whether a client will take a term deposit or not(1/0) .

Method: Since the problem is a binary classification problem meaning that it involves the dependent variable as a categorical one , so we will use logistic regression to solve this problem which I think given the data help us to reach our aim.

Steps involved:

1) Data Analysis / Exploration 
  -Plot different charts to analyse data 
  -Calculate key summary statistics as well one can ask interesting questions looking at the observations

2) Data pre-processing 
  -Handle missing values and drop uneccessary columns 
  -Use feature scaling/normalization if required -Develop raw data into useful format

3) Apply Machine learning 
  -Use feature engineering if required and handle data properly according to the way the algorithm requires (one hot encoding)      
  -Select a correct algorithm 
  -Train the model by splitting into train and validation sets -Calculate the accuracy of the model
